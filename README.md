# Sorting Algorithms: Selection Sort

This practice code is based on the course ["Strong programming foundations"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U)
by [mycodeschool.com](http://www.mycodeschool.com/).

I would strongly recommend this course to any aspiring programmer seeking to get in depth with
the C programming language. The lectures on pointers are exceptionally well presented.
